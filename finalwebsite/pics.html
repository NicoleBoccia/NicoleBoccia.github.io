<p class="picdesc">The pictures above are just a few examples of school projects, and pieces for fun that I have worked on
  over the past couple years. To make these pieces I used a variety of materials such as; acrylic paint, watercolor, pen, charcoal, canvas, hb pencils, and pencil crayons.
   Growing up I always loved to draw, but was not very good at it, I relied on tracing a lot for practice. Eventually I stopped the habit of tracing and just started to draw things free handedly.
    It started with simple drawings, and outlines of animals, then grew to shadows, and eventually hands and faces. Drawing a face can be hard to do because you don't know where to start. After a lot of practice from many different faces I eventually moved on to painting.
    I found painting to be much easier than drawing because the colours were easier to blend to create different shadows, or shades. Acrylic paint is my favourite paint to use because
    it dries fast so its easy to fix any mistakes, its cheap, it spreads easy on a canvas, and is a thick paint so you only need one layer. Cool colors such as green, and blue are my favourite colours to work with because they remind me of something tropical. I used Acrylic paint for the carousel horse, self portrait,
    wave, and the mural shown above. My second favourite type of paint is watercolour because of the way it blends. Watercolor requires a special type of canvas paper so the piece doesn't curl.
    This type of paint almost gives a translucent effect because of how thin it is, the more water you add, the less color that will show. The car is an example of a piece I did in watercolour.
    My least favourite paint to work with is oil paint, because it stains, its hard to clean off brushes, takes a long time to dry(3-5 days if not more), and requires countless hours and layers of paint to complete. Though it is one of my least favourite things to work with I do eventually want
    to get better at it because it gives a beautiful result. I have only done a few oil paintings such as a still life, but did not include it in the collage of images above. In summary I love to paint and draw, it has been a hobby of mine ever since I was a child. I never want to stop improving at it
    and am hoping that I will never have to give up this hobby, and maybe include it in a future career.
