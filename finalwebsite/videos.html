<p class="viddesc">All of the videos above were created for school projects using different programs. The programs used were Blender,
  adobe flash cs3, blender, and adobe Premier. Adobe flash cs3 is a program where you draw in the given space with either a mouse, or tablet. These drawings can be saved in a library and used later. You can also add movements to the drawings to create an animation. It is one
   of my favourite programs that I have used because of all the time and work put in. The video's schools out, and blast off were both created on flash. Blender is another program I used. This is a free program availaible at blender.org, it can be used for 3D modeling, as well as animation.
   Blender at a glance is a lot to look at and is nothing like flash, I self taught myself the basics but still have a lot to learn. I used blender to create the video/animation called Day in the Snow. For the video Ez Dust we used the program adobe Premier
   which is a video editing software. This video was created for a group project about an innovative product. Adobe Premier has a variety of different effects for both the video and audio, such as transitions and distortions.
   In summary flash is my favourite animation software, but I would still like to learn more from Blender, and brush up on some editing skills in adobe Premier.
